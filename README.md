An old project build back in 2024 as the start of my journey and posted here to preserve my path.

A Roman numeral converter application — the second project in FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. Converts Arabic numbers (1-3999) into Roman numerals with proper subtraction notation (IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM).

The project only consists of **JavaScript** + **HTML** + **CSS** and was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.

## 🎨 About the Project

The project only works in a range from 1 to 3999 so it didn't feel that hard as the Palindrome one. As far as I remember I especially liked the EventListener applying effects on pressing buttons back then. Still getting the logic right required more research to accomplish the project. It's a simple one function logic but still so sharp.
